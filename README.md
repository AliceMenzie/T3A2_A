# T3A2-A Full Stack Application #

## Libro ##

### Purpose ###

We were hired by Dymocks to provide an application that their customers can use to keep a record of books that they want to read. Currently their customers browse the bookstore and discover lots of books that really interest them. But since they don't have enough spare time they can only read a certain number of books each year. By the time they have finished reading the books they currently have, they will have forgotten the books they discovered previously. This application provides them with a space to record all the books that they discover to ensure no books are forgotten about. 

Along with a book wishlist, the application will allow users to maintain a list of books that they have read, and give those books ratings and reviews. This will allow other users to see what books are receiving high ratings, and can read the reviews from other users. This will provide a space for users to go for recommendations, inspiration and see ratings for other books.

Too often I go into a bookstore and discover dozens of books that really interest me. I would love to read them all but I struggle to find the time. I need to be able to have all the books I want to read in one place, so when I am ready to buy another book I can choose from that list.”

When friends ask me for recommendations I want a list of books that I can easily show them, and ensure I haven't forgotten any."
